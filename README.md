I wanted to try and make a budget spiderman game using free assets. It's just that my son seems to be obssesing over Spiderman games, but I just don't want to buy one for him since he's still small. 
So I found this project on Youtube and while googling for how to make some Spiderman movement tutorial I found the git of his game and decided to fork it. 

The original itself was an old project (at the time of writing this, the game was last updated 4 years ago). 
So I made some changes and was hoping to improve it somehow. It's still a WIP and probably going to stay a WIP indefinitely. 

Changes (Up to 09.06.2025): 
- Upgrade Unity to Unity 6.
- Changed to URP.
- Refactor the movement code (still need some tweaks)
- Refactor and 'trying' to improve the wall climb. (still weird and funny and disappointing at the same time)
- Separated the swinging into it's own script but other than that, it is not even touched yet, and of course not working anymore, and I was actually thinking of remaking the whole swinging mechanics. (Have the idea but not the how yet)
- Added new animations (from mixamo)
